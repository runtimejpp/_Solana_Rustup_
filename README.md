# _Solana_Rustup_


I hardly have any idea what Solana really is howeever I do know it is not quiete as decentralized as ether, I know it is new, It has had several outages(all the great ones do in the beginning..)

I know the core codebase is built with Rust and I love learning Rust and that's all i care about
